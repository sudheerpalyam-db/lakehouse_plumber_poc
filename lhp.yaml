# Optional: Enforce LakehousePlumber version requirements
# Ensures consistent code generation across development and CI environments
# required_lhp_version: ">=0.4.1,<0.5.0"  # Allow patch updates within 0.4.x
# required_lhp_version: "~=0.4.1"          # Equivalent to >=0.4.1,<0.5.0
# required_lhp_version: "==0.4.1"          # Exact version pin

# Optional: Include patterns to filter which YAML files to process
# By default, all YAML files in the pipelines directory are processed
# Uncomment and customize the patterns below to filter files
# include:
#   - "*.yaml"                    # All YAML files
#   - "bronze_*.yaml"             # Files starting with "bronze_"
#   - "silver/**/*.yaml"          # All YAML files in silver subdirectories
#   - "gold/dimension_*.yaml"     # Dimension files in gold directory
#   - "!**/temp_*.yaml"           # Exclude temporary files (prefix with !) 


## Optional: Add operational metadata columns to the generated pipelines
## These can be used to track the source of the data and the processing of the data
